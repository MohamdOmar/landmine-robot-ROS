# Autonomous_land-mine_detection_robot_ROS  2022
For my graduation project Autonomous landmine detection robot.
Our team developed an autonomous land mine detection robot using ROS. 
Our robot successfully detected and marked the mines in the field and visualize them on rviz. 
It also generated a map of the area using the gmapping package depending on data from the laser scan sensor. 
While we were able to implement the move_base package, we faced some issues while tuning its parameters.
